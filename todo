- Damage calculations SUCK !
- Perk system? - every 5 levels you get to choose an upgrade?
- Typing can't backspace when naming (calling/callit) something
- Enemy scaling 
    - More health/damage, more exp, more loot
    - Maybe just tighten the range of enemies that can spawn on each floor
        - Or have a specific range like a list of strings like "ZOCRS"
            -- This method seems good, can implement spawn chances too
- Test 'T' boss
- No trapdoor traps on boss levels, or at least prevent them from making you fall

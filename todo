- Damage calculations SUCK !
- Perk system? - every 5 levels you get to choose an upgrade?
- Typing can't backspace when naming (calling/callit) something
    - Only on linux
- Balance enemy HP -- they're dying too fast midgame (Z, O, etc.)
- No trapdoor traps on boss levels, or at least prevent them from making you fall
- Redo boss bool
    - If true, sets ISBOSS flag
    - If false, does not set
        - Should prevent boss enemies ('T', 'C', 'G', 'J', 'D') from spawning

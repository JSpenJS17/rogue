- Perk system? - every 5 levels you get to choose an upgrade?
- Add a way to set controls
- Damage Reduction based on defense (remember lower armor better)
- Make sure there aren't too many ID scrolls -- there definitely could be with new changes
- Add more status updates, seems useful <-- maybe this is where damage number goes

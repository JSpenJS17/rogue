- Perk system? - every 5 levels you get to choose an upgrade?
- Typing can't backspace when naming (calling/callit) something
    - Only on linux
- No trapdoor traps on boss levels, or at least prevent them from making you fall ?
- Add a way to set controls
- Damage Reduction based on defense (remember lower armor better)
- Add damage printouts! seems like a good idea
- Print top 10 scores even if we didn't get our top local score
    - This should print out our current rankings on the leaderboard as well
    - Need to set up GET requests
        - Needs a dev server (5001)

Just a mod so that this game feels better to play

Installation:

```
make
./rogue
```

Or download the latest binary from https://github.com/JSpenJS17/rogue/releases
**NOTE:** the Windows release needs libcurl-x64.dll in the same directory as rogue.exe or in system PATH to launch.

Huge thank you to Dave Gamble and the cJSON contributors for putting together such a good library for parsing JSON files in C.
